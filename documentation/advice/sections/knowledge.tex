\section{Knowledge}
Since ROS is a very academically focussed system, a lot of knowledge is shared on-line.
When the group ran into issues and went to the ROS version of stackoverflow, \href{https://answers.ros.org/questions/}{ROS answers}, any questions asked generally received an answer very quickly.
This is worth checking out if anyone gets stuck trying to integrate new functionality in the system, or is confused about how certain parts are implemented.
