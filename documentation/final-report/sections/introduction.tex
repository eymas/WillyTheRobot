\section{Introduction}
At the start of the minor Future Technology in 2019 Q1\&Q2, students were allowed to choose from several projects.
Among those choices was this project, known as Willy the Robot, or WTR [\ref{trm::WTR}] for short.
WTR is a long running project, with 6 groups as of this one having worked on the machine.
The goal is to create an autonomously moving robot that can provide information to visitors during public events, such as Winnovation [\ref{trm::Winnovation}].

The goal of the project was to create a robot which could drive around safely at the aforementioned event.
WTR turned out to be a fairly difficult project, as the robot is already quite expansive and cumbersome, both in terms of hardware and software.
Many parts have been made separately, and although they are mostly modular, all the moving parts do need to work together to create the cohesive whole.
Many choices made during this project reflect this modular nature, again, incorporating both the hardware and the software.

This document details the achieved progress, an explanation of the process, a summary of some security features and risks, as well as the personal reflections of the members of this group, including a group reflection.
There was enough advice to fill an entire separate document, so the decision was made to turn that into a separate report.
