\section{Motor controller}

\subsection{Integration of closed loop}
In order to improve the driving capability of WTR, a closed loop controller has to be integrated in the motor controller. 
This means adding code to integrate two quadrature rotary encoders, adding the controller itself and combining it in a control model.
The control model is explained in the analysis of the current situation section 3.5.

The architecture of the software in the arduino Mega motor controller can be seen in figure \ref{fig::Motorconarc}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Arduino Mega Code}
The main program combines sends the commands to the actual motor controller via serial bus. 
While one part of the motor controller has been made by the group, a secondary part is a pre-existing part of the original wheelchair WTR is based on.
This is considered a black box, which simply turns the brakes on and off in accordance with the commands sent from the Arduino Mega 2560.
The commands sent to the motor are refreshed at a higher frequency than the control loop is called. %why?
The flow of the main program can be found in figure \ref{fig::MPF}.

\subsection{Rotary encoders}
The rotary encoders are of the quadrature type with 256 PPR. \todo{Maybe link to a source explaining what quadrature means}
Quadrature encoders are equipped with two channels from which one is phase shifted 90 degrees compared to the second, see figure \ref{fig::QuadEnc}.
This allows a program to determine the direction in which the shaft is rotating, as well as increasing resolution.

Interrupts are generated for the rising edge and for the falling edge on the pulse train per channel and therefore increase the resolution to 1024 per revolution. 
\todo{Interrupts are generated for both the rising and falling edge, which increases the resolution to 1024 pulses per revolution.}
The speed is determined using code based on the structure which can be found in the the two flowcharts below, \ref{fig::PCF} and \ref{fig::SRC}. 
The interrupt will trigger the direction determination and call a pulse change function, which stores timestamps and calculates the frequency of the pulses.
This allows the code to track the speed, and make adjustments accordingly.
This can be found in figure \ref{fig::PCF}.

When the main program wants to know the speed, it will call a speed read function which will then calculate the speed accordingly. 
This can be found in figure \ref{fig::SRC}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Control loop}
The control loop calculates the speed error \ref{trm::speederror} per wheel based on feedback of the encoders and a reference \ref{trm::refturn} turn and drive input. 
This error is sent to \code{PIDCalculation()} which returns a turn and drive output. 
A detailed description of these calculations can be found in movement research. 
The flow of this class can be found in figure \ref{fig::CLF}.
