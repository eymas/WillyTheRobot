\section{Introduction}

This document has the purpose of explaining how the code used in the updated WTR \ref{trm::WTR} is built, what purpose it has and the design process behind it.
Each section deals with a separate aspect of the code, such as the motor controller with a PID feedback loop, the 9-axis IMU MPU9250, or the changes made to the local planner.
Every part added or changed is meant ultimately improve the quality of WTR's driving capabilities.
