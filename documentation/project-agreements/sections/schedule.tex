\subsection{Global Sprint Planning}
\noindent \textbf{Sprint 0}\\
Introduction of the projects, team building, contacting stakeholders, project plan, contact with previous groups\\
\textbf{Sprint 1}\\
Getting to grips with Willy and ROS (Robotic Operating System)\\
\textbf{Sprint 2}\\
Functional design, mechanical design\\
\textbf{Sprint 3}\\

Any spare time will be dedicated to improving other features, but the scope of those is dependent of whether or not any time is left, and the interest of the group itself.
Additionally, the way Willy is currently built leaves a lot to be desired, so in any spare time improvements in the mounting of hardware and cable-management will also be made.
