\section{Introduction}
This project plan describes a project managed by three students of Windesheim University of Applied Sciences. 
Prior to this group, other teams worked on Willy the robot as well. As such, the already existing code will have to be edited and expanded upon. 
Rather than reworking what has already been produced, it would be more efficient to focus on expanding and improving what already exists.
