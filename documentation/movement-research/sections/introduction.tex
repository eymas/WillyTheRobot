\section{Introduction}
This research is meant to create an inventory of the current state of the movements WTR\ref{trm::WTR} is capable of performing.
In addition, this document contains a list of proposed improvements in order to increase the accuracy of the autonomous driving.
By creating a list of the range of movement WTR can perform and noting any defects or issues with those, it should become easier to create a proper list of improvements.
Several sections will deal with the sensors, how they benefit the robot and their mounting as well.
