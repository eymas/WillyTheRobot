\section{Physical problems}
WTR's problems are not limited to its rear wheels.
The front wheels have their share of problems as well.

\subsection{After Effects of Collisions}
WTR is getting along in its age.
This is the 4th year of its life, and as such it has had to deal with a fair few knocks and scrapes.
One such collision ended up knocking one of the front wheels so that it was stuck at an angle.
As a result, the wheel kept scraping against the frame, and the effects can still be seen in figure ~\ref{fig::wheelclip}
